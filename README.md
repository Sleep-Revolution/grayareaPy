Method for focusing and fitting a mixture model to perturbed elements of a categorical ensemble data set.

## Scientific purpose

This github repository proposes codes to apply a method consisting of a filtering part and a mixture model applied to an ensemble of categorical variables $(y_{n1},\cdots,y_{nE})$, $\forall n \in\\{1,...,N\\}$, where E is the ensemble size and N is the sample size. The aim is to remove the element where there is a high agreement between the categorical variables $y_{n1} \approx \cdots \approx y_{nE}$ and fit a mixture model to the remaining data. This method has been developed to highlight the uncertainty in human sleep stage classification in the field of sleep studies.

The method is parameterised with two main parameters. The first is a **threshold** $\in [0,1]$ to be set by the user to remove elements where the ensemble of categorical variables takes a majority of the same value. The threshold is linked to a measure of the dispersion of the ensemble of categorical realisations called the coefficient of unalikeability $u_2$. Its meaning is that the larger the threshold, the more elements are removed where the ensemble of categorical realisations does not take a same value, thus reducing the uncertainty of the dataset. The threshold is set to 0.2 by default. The other is the number of mixture components $M$. By default, $M$ is automatically selected using BIC selection over multiple values for $M$. The EM algorithm is initialised by default with the k-means++ algorithm.

The proposed mixture model is based on a multinomial or Dirichlet distribution (work in progress for Dirichlet). 

The Python scripts and notebook files of this project are organised as follows:
* **/src/MixtureModels.py**: All method components (filtering, mixture model, EM algorithm, initialisation method);
* **/src/SimuMM.py**: Class to simulate, run and validate data and method over different parameter sets and validation criteria;
* **/SimuMM.ipynb**: Experiment parameter sets and call of simulation method;

## Simulation Study

Experimental examples are provided in the operational domain of human sleep stages. The aim is to validate the proposed method on a simulated ensemble sleep stage dataset of $E=10$ categorical variables with 4 classes corresponding to $M=3$ multinomial mixture components with 3 different probability vector parameters $p$. The method is evaluated in terms of its ability to remove elements generated by the first multinomial component parameterised with a high probability of having the class N1/N2. This component produces the case where the ensemble of categorical realisations has mostly the same value. The other two components generate samples with high uncertainty between the different classes. 

Experiments with different data sets and method parameterisations are proposed to be studied here.
